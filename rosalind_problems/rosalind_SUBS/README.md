# Finding motifs in a sequence  
In bioinformatics, it is of great importance to find out whether there are motifs (short repeating patterns) in nucleotide sequences.  
In the rosalind_subs.py file, there is a function that allows you to input 2 strings together and it will return the indices 
of the locations at which string #2 can be found in string #1.
