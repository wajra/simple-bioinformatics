# Translation of mRNA to Protein  

In this problem we find out an mRNA sequence that can be translated into a protein. Translation is part of the central dogma. DNA sequences are transcribed to mRNA sequences 
which are translated to proteins sequences.  
The translation procedure occurs through small subunits in the mRNA sequence called 'Codons'. A codon is three consecutive nucleotides in an mRNA 
sequence. Each codon is a key for either adding an amino acid or stopping the translation procedure altogether.  
In the python code, there are two functions.  
One is for making a dictionary for all possible permutations of RNA nucleotides of length 3 and the amino acid for which they code for  
The other is for translating the given sequence to the protein. Here the previously constructed dictionary is used to get the corresponding 
amino acid for each 3 consecutive mRNA nucleotides
