The 'common_modules.py' file contains several functions which perform basic bioinformatics operations. These include but are not limited to...  
1. Reading fasta files  
2. Reading text files for raw sequences  
3. Counting number of each nucleotide in a sequence  
4. Transcribing a DNA sequence to an RNA sequence  
5. Reverse-transcribing an RNA sequence to a DNA sequence  
6. Returning the complement of a sequence
