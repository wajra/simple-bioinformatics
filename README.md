# Simple Bioinformatics  

This repository contains some modules allowing for simple bioinformatic operations and solutions to rosalind.info problems  
The 'common_modules.py' file contains several functions which perform basic bioinformatics operations. These include but are not limited to...  
1. Reading fasta files  
2. Reading text files for raw sequences  
3. Counting number of each nucleotide in a sequence  
4. Transcribing a DNA sequence to an RNA sequence  
5. Reverse-transcribing an RNA sequence to a DNA sequence  
6. Returning the complement of a sequence  
and much more...  
However it must be noted that this is an exercise in reinventing the wheel. There are many other libraries with faster implementations for the same tasks. The author utilizes this code repository as a method of staying in code shape and learning how to properly document one's code.  

The author has also undertaken [Rosalind Problems](https://www.rosalind.info) that he tries to solve on a daily basis. The code that is currently in the repository is broken up into folders, one for each rosalind problem. Each folder in the rosalind_problems directory will have Python code that solves the problems, and a text file that contains the problem itself. The author is adding a solution to each problem on a daily basis and hopes to complete the rosalind challenge in about 6 months.  
You are welcome to contribute, fork and download the project to make it better and for fun.  
**Adios and happy coding!!!**
